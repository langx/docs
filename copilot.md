### Copilot

Copilot is our AI-supported way of learning.

While we are an application of exchange, culturally the same as linguistically, we still offer the opportunity to use a well trained AI-companion, whom is available 24/7. This feature is also one of the main purposes of the LangX [token](broken-reference). Get to know our new friend:
