# Wallet

A wallet keeps your wealth safe and secure. The same as you have your wallet in your bag, pocket or purse, the same you have it secured online as well. Probably the digital version is even more secure IF you handle it right. For our [token ](broken-reference)we recommend the [METAMASK-Wallet](https://metamask.io/).

1. **What Is a Crypto Wallet?**
   * A **cryptocurrency wallet** is a digital tool that allows you to interact with blockchain networks to store and manage cryptocurrencies. Think of it as a virtual wallet that can be used on computers, smartphones, or tablets to access digital currencies.
   * Contrary to popular belief, crypto wallets do **not** physically hold cryptocurrencies like the wallet in someone’s pocket. Instead, they store the **public and private keys** required to buy cryptocurrencies and provide digital signatures that authorize each transaction.
2. **How Do Cryptocurrency Wallets Work?**
   * A wallet doesn’t technically hold a user’s coins. Instead, it holds the **key** to their coins, which are stored on public blockchain networks.
   * When you send tokens, your **private key** signs the transaction and broadcasts it to the blockchain network. The network then includes the transaction to reflect the updated balance in both the sender’s and recipient’s address.
   * So, the term “wallet” is somewhat of a misnomer. Crypto wallets don’t actually store cryptocurrency like physical wallets hold cash. Instead, they read the public ledger to show balances in a user’s addresses and hold the private keys that enable transactions.
3. **Public and Private Keys:**
   * A **public key** is like a bank account number and can be shared widely. It acts as an address where someone can send you cryptocurrency.
   * The **private key** is like a bank account password or PIN and should be kept secret. It’s used to sign transactions and prove ownership of the related public key.
4. **Why Do You Need a Crypto Wallet?**
   * Your cryptocurrency is only as safe as the method you use to store it.
   * While crypto can technically be stored directly on an exchange, it’s not advisable unless in small amounts or for frequent trading.
   * For larger amounts, it’s recommended to withdraw most of it to a crypto wallet (whether hot or cold). This way, you retain ownership of your private keys and have full control over your finances.
5. **Types of Crypto Wallets:**
   * **Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet**: An offline storage device (e.g., Ledger or Trezor). It’s the most secure way to store cryptocurrencies.
   * **Mobile Wallet**: Installable apps on your mobile phone (e.g., Exodus or Atomic). Beware that some mobile apps are custodial (controlled by third parties).
   * **Software Wallet**: Installed on your computer (e.g., desktop wallets like Electrum).
   * **Paper Wallet**: A physical document with your keys printed on it.

Remember, choosing the right wallet depends on your individual needs and security preferences. Happy crypto exploring!
